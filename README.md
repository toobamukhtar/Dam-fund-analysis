# Dam-fund-analysis

We will be looking at the data released by the State Bank of Pakistan. The data is the daily bank-wise and donor-wise receipts of the fund for the Daimer Bhasha and Mohmand Dam.
We will see how to scrape data from the web, clean it, and import it into Pandas and then use it for data analysis purposes.
