# Dam-fund-analysis

Dam fund analysis I

We will be looking at the data released by the State Bank of Pakistan. The data is the daily bank-wise and donor-wise receipts of the fund for the Daimer Bhasha and Mohmand Dam.
We will see how to scrape data from the web, clean it, and import it into Pandas and then use it for data analysis purposes.

Dam fund analysis II

We will use  data exploration processes on the dataset that we have cleaned up.
We will use  graphs to visualize the data, then move on to some mathemetical descriptions of the data, and then come up with some hypotheses to explain our findings.

Dam fund analysis III

In this part we'll move beyond simply analysing the data and will instead move towards trying to make some inferences regarding the data - predictions on when the dam's target value of (the minimum estimate) 1.5 Trillion rupees will be reached.
