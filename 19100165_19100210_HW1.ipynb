    "For this homework we'll be looking at the data released by the State Bank of Pakistan. The data is the daily bank-wise and donor-wise receipts of the fund for the Daimer Bhasha and Mohmand Dam. You can find them in the following link: http://www.sbp.org.pk/notifications/FD/DamFund/Damfund.htm. Take a moment to look around the data and try to figure out what the possible challenges could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this homework is to teach how to scrape data from the web, clean it, and import it into Pandas for data analysis purposes. There are however some things to note:\n",
    "1. As you can tell, the data is in PDF form. PDF is the most difficult to handle data format and if you get extremely broken CSV files, there isn't a need to worry, that's where the cleaning part comes in.\n",
    "2. We'll be using an API to convert the data from PDF to CSV, and then from CSV to Pandas. There are, however, other ways to do this. The reason we wanted to do this method is two-fold\n",
    "    * It will teach you how to communicate with APIs using Python, which will be a useful skill when you want to deploy your data models as an API so that it can work with other APIs that need those data models. Moreover, a lot of data you get in the real world is from APIs. \n",
    "    * The CSV will be extremely inconsistent, so it will give you immense practice with using regular-expressions, which are extremely important in the Data Science tool-kit.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Submit the notebooks in a similar format to the Labs: print the relevant output in each cell **only if it has an output. The initial scraping and converting does not have any output**, and name the notebooks as:\n",
    "**rollnumber_HW1.ipynb** for e.g **20100237_H1.ipynb**\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure you complete full parts (denoted by a Header each in this notebook) as the grading will be based on parts. Needless to say, do not copy someone else's code. In most Data Science careers, the main skill is not how good you are at coding, but how well you are able to use the tools at your disposal and what inferences you are able to make with the information that you have. Thus, while you might be able to do the HW by looking at someone else's code, unless you go through the actual thought process, you won't learn a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a lot of libraries in this tutorial, make sure you go through them so you understand what they are used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: If you are more comfortable doing so, as I am, you can do the assignment on your preferred text editor on simple Python and then write the code neatly in a notebook.** Personally, I find Sublime/Vim easier to use than Jupyter, mostly since a lot of shortcuts there make coding much easier, while here the shortcuts are more about navigation and controlling your cells.\n",
